# OJT DTR & Weekly Journal System

A web-based system designed to manage **Daily Time Records (DTR)** and **Weekly Journal Reports** for On-the-Job Trainees (OJTs) and Interns.

The system centralizes attendance tracking, structured weekly reporting, admin review, certification, and data export for official university and company submission.
